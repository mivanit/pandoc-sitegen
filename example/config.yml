# other things
# ==============================
make_index_files: true # whether to treat files with `index: true` specially

# with the frontmatter from the markdown source passed as the context

# pandoc stuff
# ==============================
# these items will be passed as arguments to pandoc
# note: items which are lists (e.g. `foo: [a, b, c]`) will be passed as `--foo a --foo b --foo c`
# note: `!join` is a custom directive that will add the elements of the list together. useful for concatenating strings
__pandoc__:
  include-in-header: !join [*RESOURCES_DIR, "header.html"] # passed as '--include-in-header'

  include-after-body: !join [*RESOURCES_DIR, "after-body.html"] # passed as '--include-after-body'

  # these should be paths to any pandoc filters you'd like to use. 
  # if you dont have any, just have it be an empty list
