You may have wondered why this tool expects dot-separated paths to the content and resources directories, instead of a nested filesystem. Well, I have recently started using the excellent [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so) knowledge management system, which does things this way. It has the nice advantage of making links to assets (such as CSS or images) are fixed, regardless of where your file is in the hierarchy.

While you're here, I'm also working on a tool that makes Dendron work better with pandoc. It's also a work in progress
